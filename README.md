# Credit Score Classification Project

### Project Overview


This project aims to design a machine learning model that classifies credit scores based on the person's credit-related information. Over the years, the finance company has collected a variety of data on their customers' banking and credit information. This data is now leveraged to create an intelligent system that automates the task of categorizing individuals into credit score brackets, reducing manual efforts significantly.
